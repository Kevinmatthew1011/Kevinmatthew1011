## Hi there 👋
I'm Kevin Matthew, a web & app developer from India.

I design and build whatever I can imagine — from modern websites to smooth mobile apps.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it, polish it, and ship it.

My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, and Flutter.
I also enjoy working with UI/UX tools like Figma and sometimes dive into motion graphics.

I’ve created many websites and small apps — and I keep building more every week.

If you want to see what I’m working on, check out my pinned projects!

Fun Facts:

I enjoy designing clean UI and making things look aesthetic

Anime fan (you can ask me for recommendations 😄)

I love building websites for fun

Exploring motion graphics & creative design

Always learning new tech and improving my skills
